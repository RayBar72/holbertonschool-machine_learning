| Task | Description | File |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 0. Load the Environment | Write a function def load_frozen_lake(desc=None, map_name=None, is_slippery=False): that loads the pre-made FrozenLakeEnv evnironment from OpenAIâ€™s gym | 0-load_env.py |
| 1. Initialize Q-table | Write a function def q_init(env): that initializes the Q-table | 1-q_init.py |
| 2. Epsilon Greedy | Write a function def epsilon_greedy(Q, state, epsilon): that uses epsilon-greedy to determine the next action | 2-epsilon_greedy.py |
| 3. Q-learning | Write the function def train(env, Q, episodes=5000, max_steps=100, alpha=0.1, gamma=0.99, epsilon=1, min_epsilon=0.1, epsilon_decay=0.05): that performs Q-learning | 3-q_learning.py |
| 4. Play | Write a function def play(env, Q, max_steps=100): that has the trained agent play an episode | 4-play.py |
