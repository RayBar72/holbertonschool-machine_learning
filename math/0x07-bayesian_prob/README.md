| Task | Description | File |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 0. Likelihood | You are conducting a study on a revolutionary cancer drug and are looking to find the probability that a patient who takes this drug will develop severe side effects. During your trials, n patients take the drug and x patients develop severe side effects. You can assume that x follows a binomial distribution. | 0-likelihood.py |
| 1. Intersection | Based on 0-likelihood.py, write a function def intersection(x, n, P, Pr): that calculates the intersection of obtaining this data with the various hypothetical probabilities | 1-intersection.py |
| 2. Marginal Probability | Based on 1-intersection.py, write a function def marginal(x, n, P, Pr): that calculates the marginal probability of obtaining the data | 2-marginal.py |
| 3. Posterior | Based on 2-marginal.py, write a function def posterior(x, n, P, Pr): that calculates the posterior probability for the various hypothetical probabilities of developing severe side effects given the data | 3-posterior.py  |
