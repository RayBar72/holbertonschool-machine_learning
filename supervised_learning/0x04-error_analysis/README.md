## Content Table ##

| Task | Description | File |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 0. Create Confusion | Write the function def create_confusion_matrix(labels, logits): that creates a confusion matrix | 0-create_confusion.py |
| 1. Sensitivity | Write the function def sensitivity(confusion): that calculates the sensitivity for each class in a confusion matrix | 1-sensitivity.py |
| 2. Precision | Write the function def precision(confusion): that calculates the precision for each class in a confusion matrix | 2-precision.py |
| 3. Specificity | Write the function def specificity(confusion): that calculates the specificity for each class in a confusion matrix | 3-specificity.py |
| 4. F1 score | Write the function def f1_score(confusion): that calculates the F1 score of a confusion matrix | 4-f1_score.py |
| 5. Dealing with Error | In the text file 5-error_handling, write the lettered answer to the question of how you should approach the following scenarios. Please write the answer to each scenario on a different line. If there is more than one way to approach a scenario, please use CSV formatting and place your answers in alphabetical order (ex. A,B,C) | 5-error_handling |
