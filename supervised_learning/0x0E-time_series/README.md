| 0. When to Invest | Bitcoin (BTC) became a trending topic after its price peaked in 2018. Many have sought to predict its value in order to accrue wealth. Letâ€™s attempt to use our knowledge of RNNs to attempt just that. Given the coinbase and bitstamp datasets, write a script, forecast_btc.py, that creates, trains, and validates a keras model for the forecasting of BT | README.md, forecast_btc.py, preprocess_data.py |
